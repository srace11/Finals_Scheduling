Since in the next steps, we will be using those variables for constraints, we would end up with a very large model. In order to bypass that, instead of using the actual rooms, we will use room buckets, which will be read from a file in the next cell. Suppose the set of room buckets is $R$ and $rb \\in R$ is a room bucket. For every $rb$, there is a quantity $n_{rb}$, which will denote the number of rooms that are in that room bucket. This means that we have $n_{rb}$ rooms of size $rb$ available. You might notice that we create a room bucket of size zero, and number of rooms equal to the number of exams. That is done so we can assign all the online exams to that bucket, and that is why we set the enrollments to zero. So now instead of assigning exams to rooms, we will assign exams to room buckets, which act as a proxy for rooms."

The idea is to use this program to find good day/time combinations, and ensure that we have enough rooms for each day/time by not using more than are avaible in the room buckets. After we have the exam to day/time assignment, we can then make a different integer program that will run on each slot and find \"good\" room assignments for the exams of that slot.

    "In this dataframe, we are given pairs of exams that have students in common. The coenrollment column has the number of students in common. Ideally we want to avoid scheduling exams at the same time, when there are a lot of students that need to take both exams. To accomplish that, we will add *coenrollment conflict* constraints to the model. We will create a variable for every pair of exams that appear in the dataframe, if they also have an overlap in their prefered days, as otherwise there would be no option to schedule them at the same time. We will use those variables to disincentivize scheduling the two exams at the same time, by adding a cost proportional to the number of students in common in the objective function.\n",
