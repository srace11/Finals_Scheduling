# Finals_Scheduling
class project aiming to assign dates, times, and locations for final exams held at Cornell University for every student

In this project, you will be rebuilding part of the model that was used to schedule the Cornell Spring 2021 prelims. Our goal will be to 
assign a day/time(which will sometimes be referred to as a slot) to every exam, along with a list of rooms where the exam will take place in.

In a previous file, you had to come up with ideas for a model that solves the problem of scheduling prelims to the day, time, and rooms. Now 
you will be given a slightly modified version of the model that was used to schedule Cornell Spring 2021 prelims, complete the code that 
is provided and solve the model using Google OR-Tools.

As campuses reopen for in-person classes, implementing social distancing measures is a top priority. Students need to maintain a 6-foot 
distance in lecture halls which means the seating capacity will drop. This is an issue for large and small classes when it comes to room 
assignments. We want to enable as many students as possible to attend in-person lectures/labs so that they can get immediate help or use 
the lab computers.
