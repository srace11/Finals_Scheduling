    "Starting off, this exam schedule should be able to accomadate everyone that is taking a final and not have any overlap for any conflicts. This should be the bare minimum that the schedule would do. Each student will be assigned an exam in the schedule and make sure that no student has two exams they have to take at the same time. Some limitations that are presented are the finite amount of locations to take the exams and the amount of time in which the exams must take place. It would also be the amount of time for the tests to be graded. Some TAs might have to commit time to grading other exams for other classes so acting as if grading tests is another exam would give them more time to study for their own tests. After that, making it so that students have time spaced out between their exams will make it less stressful for them to have to study all at once. More preferably overall to not schedule two exams on the same day for one person. This can go the same for professors so that the classes they teach have exams that are spaced out. Finally, if students do have two exams on the same day, making the test locations not too far away from each other will be better so that they don't have to walk too far.\n",
